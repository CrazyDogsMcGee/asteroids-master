After the sprite starts moving, both components of velocity keep increasing, meaning that 0 is not being detected well...

velocity keeps increasing when it shouldn't. being oriented in one direction SHOULD give a sin/cos of 0, but it doesnt...

Problem with bullets...I cant just multiply on the position with the orientation because it's not a vector...I'll have to create a new vector
based aroud the center or the drawing point that changes depending on the orientation

the position of my image is always its upper left-hand corner.
Something I could do instead is take the "center" of the image and then have a radius vector that I oculd apply the angle to.

The background image callback is not being called at all. I can't reposition it at all.
